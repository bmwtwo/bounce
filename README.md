# Bounce

## Overview/Background
I created this game to entertain myself while waiting overnight for a flight at
the Newark airport. It's a bit of a follow-up to [Dodge](https://github.com/bmwtwo/dodge), and features more fluid movement. Bounce has less of a goal though. It's just somewhat mesmerizing to look at.

## Controls
Use the WASD keys to move, and the N key to spawn new particles. Particles are
attracted to the ball the user controls, and are repelled by each other.
