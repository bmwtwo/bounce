# Dodge

I created this game to entertain myself while waiting overnight for a flight at
the Newark airport. Use the WASD keys to dodge the oncoming blocks. Eventually I
got tired of this game (and I wasn't really a fan of its somewhat "jerky"
movement), so I created [Bounce](https://github.com/bmwtwo/bounce).
